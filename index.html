    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, 
    before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4>Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's really messed up too</h4>
    <!-- Commenting some stuff w'heyyyy-->
    <p>Making a pizza is similar to coding. There are
    certain things we have to do first. Like making the base, letting it rise, mould 
    the base out, add the sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake and cut and serve.
    Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do start out in the same way as long as you follow
    the order correctly. You cam jave everything you need to make many different pizas using the same
    base structure that is set up before hand.
